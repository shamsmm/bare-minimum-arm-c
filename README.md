# Bare Minimum Assembly and Makefile To Get Started With ARM
## What is this
This repository contains the bare minimum to get started with the STM32F103XX microcontroller *assembly programming*, which features a Cortex-M3 ARM processor.

This repository uses the GNU Compiler Collection `arm-none-eabi-gcc` with it's subcommands, and a **very simple** `makefile` showing various commands needed.

## Motivation
I have had lots of experiences with embedded systems, but through the limited, abstracted window of the Arduino IDE, also I had experience in assembly programming, with the Zilog Z80 80's processor.

So why not try programming an ARM microcontroller with my knowledge in embedded systems and bare assembly programming!

## Repo Branches
This repository might have many branches as some templates or some scratch code that might use some feature here and there.

## Code Comments
I have commented every line of code I could comment on, and for sure will keep adding documentation, references and much more to any code that I write, I don't want anybody to go through the painful process of debugging and to commit pitfalls that I personally did before.
